# Email_Agent_Template

to compose emails based on saved templates and automatic start and endings

agent can call templates based from his/her dropbox based on certain input, which then composes an email.

I am doing customer service, hence, my idea. It might make things easier for me (pls dont get confused about the categories, those are just the once, I deal with on the daily).
